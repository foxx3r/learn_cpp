You need both of the following components to build C++ programs.

**1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Provides tools for writing source code. Any text editor can be used as an IDE.

2. **Compiler**: Compiles source code into the final executable program. There are a number of C++ compilers available. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler.


Various C++ IDEs and compilers are available. We'll use a free tool called **Code::Blocks**, which includes both an IDE and a compiler, and is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

To download Code::Blocks, go to http://www.codeblocks.org/, Click the **Downloads** link, and choose **"Download the binary release"**.

Choose your OS and download the setup file, which includes the C++ compiler (For Windows, it's the one with **mingw** in the name).
