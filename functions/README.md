# Functions

**A function** is a group of statements that perform a particular task.

You may define your own functions in C++.

Using functions can have many advantages, including the following:

- You can reuse the code within a function.

- You can easily test individual functions.

- If it's necessary to make any code modifications, you can make modifications within a single function, without altering the program structure.

- You can use the same function for different inputs.

```diff
! Every valid C++ program has at least one function - the main() function.
```
